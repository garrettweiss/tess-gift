After making code or config changes to this project, run the launch command so the user can test:

1. From the project root, run: `npm run dev`
2. Run it in the background (so the server stays up)
3. Tell the user the Local and Network URLs from the output so they can open the app in the browser or on their phone

If the user asks to "run" or "launch" or "test" the app, run `npm run dev` in the background and share the URLs.
